            "abstract": "The phrase \"test your mettle\" means to test what one is made of, what one is prepared to endure. In both testing and automation development, we often have to endure suboptimal situations and difficult challenges such as unrealistic expectations, resistance to change, and an insistence that automation has to come from test cases.\n\nIn coping with these challenges, many people find solace in music; listening to and playing music can be a cathartic experience. Music, specifically titles and lyrics, can also be thought-provoking and motivating. Paul Grizzaffi, a self-proclaimed metalhead and rock-a-holic, is one of those people who is greatly affected by music. He not only has experience with testing and automation, he’s quite the aficionado of heavy music. His love of automation, testing, and music inspired the pun in the title.\n\nJoin us as Paul takes us on a tour of some impactful lyrics and song titles that frame memorable messages about testing and automation. Among the featured messages: we make our own expectations, automation is software development, and there are important business aspects related to automation and testing that cannot be ignored. \n\nTakeaways:\n\u2022 Find your friendlies; they can help evangelize your message\n\u2022 Automation does not replace testers; it does not have to come from test cases\n\u2022 Only automate if there is value, not just because of process.",

            "abstract": "\"Information Security: Everyone’s job every day\" (… and that includes testers!) Security is too important to ignore, so we will look at all of the ways that we as testers need to collaborate with our Security professionals and our developers to ensure that security is addressed well in our project’s testing and verifications.\n\nWe will first lay a foundation of security concepts and terminology.  Then we will walk through the 5 Layers of Security Testing and explore what is involved in doing a good job of each.\n\n1. Test Security Features.  We will start by looking at some of the security mechanisms our developers design into their code (e.g. encryption) and the ways we can collaborate with them to design good White-Box tests.  Then we will turn our attention to the various types of Security Requirements so we can ensure that our system testing of those requirements is adequate.\n\n2. Perform Negative Testing.  Not just for quality purposes, negative testing is also an important part of our security testing.  In this context, we will look at both white-box and black-box Fuzz Testing.\n\n3. Test Misuse and Abuse Cases.  To our consideration of Use Cases, we should add Abuse Cases and Misuse Cases – How might people abuse or misuse the system and how should it respond?\n\n4. Test for Common Bugs that open Vulnerabilities.  The mistakes the developers make that have the side-effect of opening security vulnerabilities are widely published and well known.  (Think buffer overflow.)  We will look at some to the best sources of this information and discuss how testers can collaborate with their developers to find those mistakes early.\n\n5. Ensure Readiness for Release.  We will look at the final verifications and testing that can confirm that the system is secure enough to release, including Penetration Testing.",

            "abstract": "Big data is a buzzword that describes a huge volume of both structured and unstructured data that is huge and challenging to process using traditional software engineering techniques. This extensive data is processed through Hadoop ecosystem.\n\nWhile big data provides solutions to complex business problems, it poses bigger challenges in testing these scenarios such as effectively managing, maintaining and using the data. This makes testing big data applications different and significantly more complex than testing regular applications. Data is transferred and transformed among many services and needs to be validated at various transition points and processes such as data ingestion, data processing and data storage.\n\nWe will be focusing on how to interact with these components in a test automation framework:\n1. HDFS – Highly fault-tolerant distributed file system for processing large data sets.\n2. HBASE – Highly scalable non-relational database.\n3. KAFKA - A messaging system that lets you send messages between processes, applications, and servers.\n4. SOLR – Lucene based search platform.\n\nWe will demonstrate the processes and tools we have successfully implemented in our test automation. By using this automation approach, we have achieved faster feedback and low manual intervention during the testing process. This helped us a lot to do effective functional verification and getting accurate results. We will explore different ways and also share tips that can help every tester, new or seasoned, to understand how to use automation as part of testing the above-mentioned Hadoop ecosystem components.",

How do you know that it still works when making future changes?\n\nI’ve been working in data warehouse environments for several years on ETL projects.  I’ve had success implementing automated testing in this domain, but one comment that hear frequently from ETL developers is “oh, you can’t test this Informatica workflow…it’s just too complicated…we don’t have data for that…”.  Well, I think the questions in the first paragraph still apply.  How do I know that my ETL process works if I can’t test it?\n\nIn this session we will focus on unit tests that are applicable in the ETL domain.

A testing pipeline was created to verify the integrity of the automated test cases, and to build docker containers for simple execution of the tests. These containers could then be simply re-used by developers and the DevOps team to verify the application. Max will walk through the feedback loop created, which allowed verification of the application go from hours to minutes.\n\nMax will discuss what processes and paths were taken to achieve continuous testing on this project. While he will cover the tools used and why they were chosen, the main focus will be on the HOW and WHY certain patterns and activities were performed. These choices were critical to achieving continuous testing, rather than just good testing coverage in CI or CD, even allowing a push left for performance and security. Additionally, some time will be spent on the organizational and culture changes that occured, and how he was able to accomplish this push for adoption in an organization that resisted automation, and had major quality problems.",

            "title": "The Automation Firehose: Be Strategic and Tactical",
            "abstract": "The widespread adoption of test automation has led to numerous challenges that range from development lifecycle integration to simple scripting strategy. Just because a scenario CAN be automated does not mean it SHOULD be automated. Teams that adopt automation often rush to automate everything they can -- the automation firehose. For those scenarios that should automated, every team must adopt an implementation plan to ensure value is derived from reliable automated test execution. In this session, the audience will learn how to automate both strategically and tactically to maximize the benefits of automation. Entry criteria will be demonstrated for automation in the development lifecycle along with a set of checks to determine automation feasibility & ROI.",

            "abstract": "Traditional testing isn't keeping pace with the speed of DevOps and Continuous Delivery, but hope is not lost; AI will be used to make testing faster and more accessible to all.\n\nExisting QA solutions were built for a world where software changed infrequently. Highly adopted tools such as Selenium, Appium, and JUnit require a specialized skillset, and require too much maintenance once you start factoring in the brittle nature of tests, and the infrastructure required to run tests at scale. But there is still hope for QA in machine intelligence. Next-generation ML tools are here to help QA keep up with the agility of modern software delivery practices. You'll learn what ML strategies are being employed to make this possible, and what the future of QA - intelligent testing - looks like.\n\nTakeaways:\n\u2022An overview of the QA tooling and vendor landscape\n\u2022Demystifying the buzzwords - what machine intelligence in testing means today and tomorrow\n\u2022How implementing DevTestOps can help increase test coverage and improve product quality",

            "title": "Dev(QA)Ops Journey",
            "abstract": "DevOps is inconceivable without QA. In this presentation, the role of \"QA\" in \"Devops\" world will be discussed and real time project examples will be provided.\n\nNo one likes to witness bugs seeping into production, leading to innumerable issues and wasteful expenditure. At the same time, business teams can ill-afford to wait for months on end to test and release their new features into the hands of ever-demanding customers. This is why many teams have now come to embrace Devops & Agile, as their go to. DevOps represents a significant change and plays a vital role in calling for testing at frequent intervals in a more automated fashion. QA teams have a huge place in a DevOps environment and all it requires is some adaptation and a sound DevOps testing strategy. In traditional approaches, QA has effectively played the role of a gatekeeper for many successful software deliveries, but in a DevOps environment, QA plays a pivotal role in thinning the boundaries among various teams leading to faster deliveries. Traditionally, the role of QA is to detect defects, but in the DevOps age, the prime responsibility of QA team will be more on preventing defects than finding them. This approach, not only helps “speed to market” but also helps in shortening the feedback cycle. ",
