Senior stakeholders ask questions such as:\n- \"How do we know we're executing the RIGHT tests?\"\n- \"How many tests do we need to test this release thoroughly?\"\n- \"What exactly does this test suite cover?\" and\n- \"What things are we NOT covering with our tests?\"\n\nWhen large numbers of tests are selected and documented by hand, clear answers to those straightforward questions are often frustratingly elusive.\n\nThis presentation will describe how proven test generation approaches, while not a \"silver bullet\" to all testing challenges, usually deliver large benefits to:\n- Speed of test selection and test documentation / scripting\n- Creation of objectively better tests (being much more thorough and less wastefully repetitive)\n- Clear communications between teams (around scope and coverage reporting)","time":"9:15 - 10:15","room":"Great Hall 3","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/justinhunter/","twitter":"","website":"https://hexawise.com/","linkedin2":"","twitter2":"","website2":"","youtube":"","youtube2":""}},"context":{}}
