As a new tester—and the first within his organization, Ben takes that background and previous experience and tries to apply it to find innovative ways to help improve quality across the organization. He has had some great successes and failures and hopes to share those with the testing community. When not testing, Ben enjoys hanging with his family which includes 2 kiddos, a 5-year-old and 8-month-old, his wife and his old dog Dexter, who is a dachshund mix.","bio2":"","title":"Ensemble Testing: Creating A Mob: A New Tester’s Journey to Getting People Together To Test","abstract":"As someone new to the QA and the testing community, within his organization, Ben was experiencing difficulties testing stemming from communication issues across teams. It felt like he was often the middle-man in a game of telephone between stakeholders, often making it difficult to efficiently manage how they test new features and products. To help address this issue, Ben incorporated ensemble testing into their testing culture. He will focus on what he has found to be the benefits of ensemble testing (such as improved communication and relationships among teams & spreading product knowledge), helpful hints for making sure the sessions go well (such as being prepared ahead of times & following up and using temporary Slack channels as a tool), and his journey of how, as a new tester, he helped his organization leverage ensemble testing to overcome communication difficulties and improve the speed and impact of their testing efforts.","time":"9:15 - 10:15","room":"Cartoon Room","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/ben-oconis-37335849/","twitter":"https://twitter.com/benoconis?lang=en","website":"","linkedin2":"","twitter2":"","website2":"","youtube":"","youtube2":""}},"context":{}}
