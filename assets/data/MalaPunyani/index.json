As quality engineering teams continue to increase investment in test automation of Salesforce applications, new challenges arise in complexity of requirements, ability to scale coverage, and successful implementation across teams to scale.\n\nMala Punyani, Engineering Manager at Splunk was tasked with identifying and implementing an end-to-end testing solution, which would address diverse business needs including API tests, PDF verification for invoicing, ERP system integration, SOQL query validation and running Apex batches. Because UI based automation leads to heavy maintenance, especially after small changes in UI and SFDC screen objects, Mala and her team partnered with their R&D teams to identify a successful automation of their dynamic APIs and test automation practices for their teams and business.\n\nIn this talk, Mala will share a holistic view of the challenges of traditional software testing in the complex Salesforce testing ecosystem and provide a roadmap for leaders to overcome implementation roadblocks in partnership with R&D teams. Finally, Mala will demonstrate how an investment of a DevOps solution with a Sauce Labs integration helped her agile team achieve time reduction of up to 50% for overall flow, while doubling release velocity without additional headcount. If you are a manager looking to scale end-to-end testing coverage and/or wondering how to make your Salesforce test automation less painful, you won’t want to miss this leadership session.","time":"9:15 - 10:15","room":"Great Hall 1 & 2","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/mala-punyani-pmp-csm-b054144/","twitter":"","website":"","linkedin2":"","twitter2":"","website2":"","youtube":"","youtube2":""}},"context":{}}
