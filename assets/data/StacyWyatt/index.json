She started working in QA in 2014 and was placed on the flagship team where one of the first bugs she found was in the code written by the CEO. After learning a lot about testing in an Agile environment, Stacy made the move into Management. She is now Managing the most talented team of SDET's that she's ever worked with!","bio2":"","title":"Our automated journey worked!","abstract":"Six very short months ago, we did not have any automation around big chunks of our product, specifically Salesforce. We set out with a plan to change that! We learned a lot along the way, changed our plans a few times, took drastic measures at others, developed a style guide, changed our development process/culture, and now, we are running a full automated regression suite with every pull request. And if our suite fails, there is no workaround. Everyone stops to understand what caused the fail and fix it.\n\nThis has been a huge change in thinking for everyone, not just QA. Product has to understand our step and that they may not get their feature on their pace. Developers had to tighten up their code so it doesn't immediately fail the first round of testing. And Managers had to step in and help everyone understand the value of this new process.\n\nI cannot be more proud of the work we've done or how my team has stepped up! I want to share this so that others can start making a plan to automate their tests and improve quality in their products!","time":"10:30 - 11:30","room":"Student Alumni Room","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/stacymwyatt/","twitter":"https://twitter.com/stacywyatt","website":"","linkedin2":"","twitter2":"","website2":"","youtube":"","youtube2":""}},"context":{}}
