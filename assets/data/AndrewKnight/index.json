Tests could offer so much value if they were openly shared—with developers, product owners, and perhaps even end-users. So, why don’t we open our tests like we open our source? There are so many parallel benefits: helping others learn, helping teams develop higher-quality software, and helping users gain confidence in the products they use. Opening tests includes sharing the tools, frameworks, and even test cases themselves. With AI and ML technologies, we could even build a future where generic open tests for common behaviors could run on any kind of app. In this keynote, we will look at ways a team could be more open about testing. Not every team may be able to publicly publish their tests, but any team could still benefit from the openings that shift-left practices can bring. Open Testing could be revolutionary. Let’s make it a reality!","time":"12:45 - 1:45","room":"US Bank Theater","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-leland-knight/","twitter":"https://twitter.com/AutomationPanda","website":"https://automationpanda.com/","linkedin2":"","twitter2":"","website2":"","youtube":"","youtube2":""}},"context":{}}
