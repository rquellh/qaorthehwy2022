RPA often operates on the user interface (UI) layer to capture data or interact with an application or across multiple applications to perform tasks that are considered repetitive or time-consuming. Originally focused on business processes, many RPA solutions now integrate with SDLC tools. While the promises of easy adoption and scaling are made by almost every vendor, the reality is long-term commitment to an RPA program is the same as any new application. In this presentation, the audience will learn about the benefits of RPA, multiple RPA use cases, and how RPA can be assimilated into a enterprise.","time":"12:45 - 1:45","room":"Great Hall 1 & 2","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/thomas-haver/","twitter":"https://twitter.com/COGSfun","website":"https://red-green-refactor.com/","linkedin2":"","twitter2":"","website2":"","youtube":"","youtube2":""}},"context":{}}
