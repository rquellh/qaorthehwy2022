We advocate for quality in all things and we advocate for the end user. We push our teams to be more quality focused and to do what is functional but also good for a user. But, none of us actually think about how our varied backgrounds influence what we do and how we test. In this session we will explore how our previous (and current) experiences subconsciously affect our testing and how to bring those experiences to the forefront in order to be better testers all around. We’ll discuss how experiences we’ve had, both current and previous, affect how and what we test. By recognizing that our individual life experiences flavor the way we test and interact, we can be better testers and teammembers. Attendees will see how their varied backgrounds influence their testing and make them better testers.","time":"10:30 - 11:30","room":"Great Hall 3","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/amanda-perkins-bbaa3020/","twitter":"https://twitter.com/theqadiva","website":"","linkedin2":"","twitter2":"","website2":"","youtube":"","youtube2":""}},"context":{}}
