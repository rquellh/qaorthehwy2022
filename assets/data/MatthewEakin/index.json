Should it be the testers who have never written a line of code in their life? Should it be the developers who have resisted testing their entire professional career? Should you hire a contractor who hopefully knows what they are doing? Deciding is often the easy part. In this session we will explore the complexities and challenges of what it takes to turn manual testers into respectable Software Developers in the Service of Testing (yes, this is possible), what it takes to make developers respectable Testers (yes, this too is possible), and many options in-between.","time":"3:05 - 4:05","room":"Cartoon Room","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthew-eakin-34568ba/","twitter":"","website":"","linkedin2":"","twitter2":"","website2":"","youtube":"","youtube2":""}},"context":{}}
