AST has multiple delivery units, where each has its own isolated way of testing. We recognized the need for a better way of test management. We started with a Testing Repository of standardized resources that all delivery units could customize and use for their projects. We migrated from an Excel-based testing approach to one using an ALM (Application Lifecycle Management) solution that is linked to our JIRA issue management system. This approach provides transparency to our clients and to our internal team throughout the testing lifecycle. Our testing process is now uniform across delivery organizations, increasing customer service and satisfaction.","time":"3:05 - 4:05","room":"Interfaith Room","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/mohita-prasad-4a03b718b/","twitter":"","website":"","linkedin2":"","twitter2":"","website2":"","youtube":"","youtube2":""}},"context":{}}
