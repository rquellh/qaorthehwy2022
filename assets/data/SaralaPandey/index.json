Without the right process and people, quality will be either a cost center or forgotten component by development. To achieve organizational success, enterprise quality must take action to build quality from top down.\nManagers must accept responsibility for the quality practice within the organization and promote it across the organization. Everyone is responsible for quality, not just QA. The journey is fraught with obstacles â€“ maturing the quality practice of an organization builds long term success with robust process and will train employees.","time":"3:05 - 4:05","room":"Great Hall 3","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/sarala-pandey-37a8105/","twitter":"","website":"","linkedin2":"","twitter2":"","website2":"","youtube":"","youtube2":""}},"context":{}}
