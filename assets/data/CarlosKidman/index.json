Traditional strategies and techniques, like testing phases and code freezes, do not work at scale and quickly add friction, reduce productivity, and make testing and quality harder.\n\nIn this presentation, we will cover different ideas and strategies to make things like BDD and TDD easier to adopt at the beginning, how to include observability and operability in your definition of quality, and how leveraging ML/AI can augment your devs and testers and reduce risk while accelerating value.\n\nBy the end, you will have some \"low quality\" indicators that you can use to identify patterns and practices that won't scale well. You will have new insights and ideas for how you can set up your teams and strategies for success long term, and you will see tangible, practical examples you can take to your team and company to start this transformation now.","time":"3:05 - 4:05","room":"Great Hall 1 & 2","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/carlos-kidman/","twitter":"https://twitter.com/CarlosKidman","website":"","linkedin2":"","twitter2":"","website2":"","youtube":"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNvYBOCETf7MByrYKDTU3fQ","youtube2":""}},"context":{}}
