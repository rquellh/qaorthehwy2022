When the BDD is not used properly.","abstract":"Behavior-driven development attempts to solve the problem of implementing poorly defined requirements. Our client is in chemical Industry. Hence, it was quite difficult for my team to adapt quickly the corresponding business. To be more precise, in order to build the product, we should understand mathematical models, equations and the glossary of chemical terms. BDD was the solution. Management team heard the magic buzzword \"BDD\" and hope that it will solve our challenges. However, nobody follows the principles of BDD and finally BDD became just another \"automation tool\". Business users continued to send documents and emails with the requirements, Developers never used the BDD approach, Analysis team did not follow the patterns to write correct Gherkin syntax as prescribed by the BDD creators etc. The result for the project was just a big mess. In order to address the problems, we had some mini trainings for all our team regarding the correct principles of BDD. We also trained customers with webinars and show them how can write Gherkin files. Also, we have introduced the three amigos concept. Hence, my proposal is this: Do you want to use BDD? Use it right else it will just create more complexity.","time":"1:55 - 2:55","room":"Student Alumni Room","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/petros-plakogiannis/","twitter":"https://mobile.twitter.com/petros_2","website":"","linkedin2":"","twitter2":"","website2":"","youtube":"","youtube2":""}},"context":{}}
