Artificial intelligence is being employed in just about all walks of life - from virtual assistants to self-driving cars. How does this new way of life impact software testing? What is our role...is there even one?\n\nOf course there is! While the future of artificial intelligence is mostly unknown, remember that as testers, one of our strongest assets is being able to discover and report the unknown. Many software developers jump at the opportunity to learn and implement the new skills required for artificial intelligence. Let’s get on board and take our place in making history!\n\nIn this talk, Angie Jones will share her personal journey in learning how to test AI-based applications, her views on the tester’s role in an artificial world, the skills needed to test such applications, and the impact that a tester can make in this space.\n\nKey Takeaways:\n- You will gain a better understanding of the testable features of AI\n- You will examine the skills needed to test AI\n- You will explore the impact that testers can have on developing AI applications","time":"8:00 - 9:00","room":"East Ballroom"}}]},"session2":{"edges":[{"node":{"speaker":"Ben Oconis","speaker2":"","title":"Ensemble Testing: Creating A Mob: A New Tester’s Journey to Getting People Together To Test","abstract":"As someone new to the QA and the testing community, within his organization, Ben was experiencing difficulties testing stemming from communication issues across teams. It felt like he was often the middle-man in a game of telephone between stakeholders, often making it difficult to efficiently manage how they test new features and products. To help address this issue, Ben incorporated ensemble testing into their testing culture. He will focus on what he has found to be the benefits of ensemble testing (such as improved communication and relationships among teams & spreading product knowledge), helpful hints for making sure the sessions go well (such as being prepared ahead of times & following up and using temporary Slack channels as a tool), and his journey of how, as a new tester, he helped his organization leverage ensemble testing to overcome communication difficulties and improve the speed and impact of their testing efforts.","time":"9:15 - 10:15","room":"Cartoon Room"}},{"node":{"speaker":"Mala Punyani","speaker2":"","title":"Why Salesforce Test Automation Shouldn’t Be Painful","abstract":"Today enterprise applications like Salesforce are now at the heart of business processes and 59% of organizations deploy a new software build daily. As quality engineering teams continue to increase investment in test automation of Salesforce applications, new challenges arise in complexity of requirements, ability to scale coverage, and successful implementation across teams to scale.\n\nMala Punyani, Engineering Manager at Splunk was tasked with identifying and implementing an end-to-end testing solution, which would address diverse business needs including API tests, PDF verification for invoicing, ERP system integration, SOQL query validation and running Apex batches. Because UI based automation leads to heavy maintenance, especially after small changes in UI and SFDC screen objects, Mala and her team partnered with their R&D teams to identify a successful automation of their dynamic APIs and test automation practices for their teams and business.\n\nIn this talk, Mala will share a holistic view of the challenges of traditional software testing in the complex Salesforce testing ecosystem and provide a roadmap for leaders to overcome implementation roadblocks in partnership with R&D teams. Finally, Mala will demonstrate how an investment of a DevOps solution with a Sauce Labs integration helped her agile team achieve time reduction of up to 50% for overall flow, while doubling release velocity without additional headcount. If you are a manager looking to scale end-to-end testing coverage and/or wondering how to make your Salesforce test automation less painful, you won’t want to miss this leadership session.","time":"9:15 - 10:15","room":"Great Hall 1 & 2"}},{"node":{"speaker":"Justin Hunter","speaker2":"","title":"Too Much to Test and Not Enough Time? - How to systematically generate the most powerful tests for your needs.","abstract":"Testing managers frequently feel the stress of having too much given the demanding deadlines and strict resource constraints they're operating under.

However, performance is still a critical part of the user experience, and poor performance and outages will quickly negate the value of the features you’re delivering. Lee believes that organizations don’t have to gamble with application performance. He will discuss techniques for implementing continuous performance testing in your pipeline, so you don’t have to roll the dice on your user experience. Topics will include performance testing activities at each stage of the pipeline – from the unit level through testing in production. You will also learn how to rethink your approach to performance testing and work with your DevOps practices instead of against them in areas like test environment and data management. You’ll walk away with a new outlook on performance testing in DevOps and ideas you can begin to implement in your pipeline.","time":"10:30 - 11:30","room":"Cartoon Room"}},{"node":{"speaker":"Leandro Melendez","speaker2":"","title":"Performance and Beyond","abstract":"Performance testing has been moving and jumping around with Site Reliability, SETs, and many new methodologies arising like Agile, DevOps, Scrum Continuous, and many more.\n\nBut sadly not many organizations or professionals have been able to move and evolve with the new set of requirements for the performance engineer.\n\nLearn about why the trade of the performance scripter is dying (or at least diminishing), why it is not suitable anymore for these modern times, and how to tackle the new challenge of not only testing our system's performance...

We advocate for quality in all things and we advocate for the end user. We push our teams to be more quality focused and to do what is functional but also good for a user. But, none of us actually think about how our varied backgrounds influence what we do and how we test. In this session we will explore how our previous (and current) experiences subconsciously affect our testing and how to bring those experiences to the forefront in order to be better testers all around. We’ll discuss how experiences we’ve had, both current and previous, affect how and what we test. By recognizing that our individual life experiences flavor the way we test and interact, we can be better testers and teammembers. Attendees will see how their varied backgrounds influence their testing and make them better testers.","time":"10:30 - 11:30","room":"Great Hall 3"}},{"node":{"speaker":"Jamie Kelley","speaker2":"","title":"Automation eVALUEation","abstract":"We all know that Automation Testing has been a major enterprise focus for the last 10 years. Often times we spend so much effort getting the automation in progress and being built that we never think how do we get value from those tests.\n\nSo if you ever wondered why do we spend so much money on automation? If you've ever thought about how do these tests benefit us? If automation has just become another checkbox for your teams but doesn't seem to help. This will be the session for you.\n\nWe'll go over what types of Automation Testing there are. How to get the best return on investment for each type. We'll learn what their limitations are.

We set out with a plan to change that! We learned a lot along the way, changed our plans a few times, took drastic measures at others, developed a style guide, changed our development process/culture, and now, we are running a full automated regression suite with every pull request. And if our suite fails, there is no workaround. Everyone stops to understand what caused the fail and fix it.\n\nThis has been a huge change in thinking for everyone, not just QA. Product has to understand our step and that they may not get their feature on their pace. Developers had to tighten up their code so it doesn't immediately fail the first round of testing. And Managers had to step in and help everyone understand the value of this new process.\n\nI cannot be more proud of the work we've done or how my team has stepped up! I want to share this so that others can start making a plan to automate their tests and improve quality in their products!","time":"10:30 - 11:30","room":"Student Alumni Room"}},{"node":{"speaker":"Eran Kinsbruner","speaker2":"","title":"How to Make a Market-Driven Decision on Test Automation Frameworks","abstract":"In this rapidly evolving world of app development and testing, how does one pick a test automation framework?

Sure, we can follow the typical QA model and just stop bugs from happening at the end, OR we can advocate for quality at all stages of a project in order to outperform and transform!\n\nEnsuring the quality of a product is difficult to do if you only begin to worry about it at the end of a project, and yet the QA role that is tasked with ensuring quality is traditionally treated as the last stop for development. Instead, it is better for QA to be involved in advocating for the quality of the product from the very first stages. What does quality advocacy look like? How do you implement it and continue to engage with all factors of discovery and development throughout the duration of a project? Finally, what are the benefits of having quality advocacy as opposed to traditional quality assurance? Quality Assurance is a team effort; therefore strong relationships between Quality Assurance Analysts and Developers are vital.","time":"12:45 - 1:45","room":"Cartoon Room"}},{"node":{"speaker":"Thomas Haver","speaker2":"","title":"The Rise and Benefits of Robotic Process Automation","abstract":"Robotic Process Automation (RPA) is a term given to technology that allows developers to programmatically emulate the actions of a human to execute a business process. RPA often operates on the user interface (UI) layer to capture data or interact with an application or across multiple applications to perform tasks that are considered repetitive or time-consuming. Originally focused on business processes, many RPA solutions now integrate with SDLC tools. While the promises of easy adoption and scaling are made by almost every vendor, the reality is long-term commitment to an RPA program is the same as any new application. In this presentation, the audience will learn about the benefits of RPA, multiple RPA use cases, and how RPA can be assimilated into a enterprise.","time":"12:45 - 1:45","room":"Great Hall 1 & 2"}},{"node":{"speaker":"Jeff Sing","speaker2":"","title":"Quality Leadership, Testing, and Governance Tactics that Make or Break Your Progressive Delivery System","abstract":"More and more companies are using Progressive Delivery to get all types of changes – new features, configuration changes, bug fixes, and experiments – into production in a safer, faster, and most importantly, a sustainable way.\n\nSoftware companies that shift to Progressive Delivery benefit from low risk releases, faster time to market, higher quality, and in general happier teams.

AST has multiple delivery units, where each has its own isolated way of testing. We recognized the need for a better way of test management. We started with a Testing Repository of standardized resources that all delivery units could customize and use for their projects. We migrated from an Excel-based testing approach to one using an ALM (Application Lifecycle Management) solution that is linked to our JIRA issue management system.

Tests could offer so much value if they were openly shared—with developers, product owners, and perhaps even end-users. So, why don’t we open our tests like we open our source? There are so many parallel benefits: helping others learn, helping teams develop higher-quality software, and helping users gain confidence in the products they use. Opening tests includes sharing the tools, frameworks, and even test cases themselves. With AI and ML technologies, we could even build a future where generic open tests for common behaviors could run on any kind of app. In this keynote, we will look at ways a team could be more open about testing. Not every team may be able to publicly publish their tests, but any team could still benefit from the openings that shift-left practices can bring. Open Testing could be revolutionary.

Hence, it was quite difficult for my team to adapt quickly the corresponding business. To be more precise, in order to build the product, we should understand mathematical models, equations and the glossary of chemical terms. BDD was the solution. Management team heard the magic buzzword \"BDD\" and hope that it will solve our challenges. However, nobody follows the principles of BDD and finally BDD became just another \"automation tool\". Business users continued to send documents and emails with the requirements, Developers never used the BDD approach, Analysis team did not follow the patterns to write correct Gherkin syntax as prescribed by the BDD creators etc. The result for the project was just a big mess. In order to address the problems, we had some mini trainings for all our team regarding the correct principles of BDD. We also trained customers with webinars and show them how can write Gherkin files. Also, we have introduced the three amigos concept. Hence, my proposal is this: Do you want to use BDD?
